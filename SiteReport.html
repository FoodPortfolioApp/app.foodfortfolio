        <h2>Working with Css & HTML</h2>
      <ul class="Section1">
      <li>
        Learning HTML and CSS is often the starting point for many aspiring web developers, and it was both exciting and challenging to me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Practical hands-on experience is key to solidifying understanding. Building simple web pages from scratch and experimenting with different HTML elements and CSS styles helps reinforce concepts and fosters creativity. 
      </li>
       <li>
        Troubleshooting errors and learning from mistakes is also an integral part of the learning process.
       </li>
       <li>
        Continuous practice, exploration, and a willingness to learn are essential for mastering HTML and CSS and laying a strong foundation for web development journey.
       </li>
       <li>
        Community forums, coding communities, and online platforms provide valuable support and guidance, allowing learners to connect with others, seek help, and share their progress.
       </li>
       <li>
        Advanced topics such as responsive design, CSS frameworks, preprocessors like Sass, and CSS animations and transitions. Continuous practice, exploration, and a willingness to learn are essential for mastering HTML and CSS and laying a strong foundation for web development journey.

      <h2>Reflective discussion of module experience</h2>
      <ul class="Section2">
      <li>
        As I have chosen FOOD PORTFOLIO and displayed some images and shown some animated images as well using CSS & Html,Reflecting on the experience of learning HTML and CSS, it's clear that it's been both enlightening and challenging.
      </li>
      <li>
        Initially, grasping the basic concepts of HTML, such as understanding the structure of web documents and the purpose of various tags, felt like stepping into a new world. However, as I delved deeper into tutorials and practical exercises, I began to appreciate the logical simplicity of HTML and its role as the backbone of web development.
      </li>
       <li>
        CSS, on the other hand, presented a different set of challenges. While HTML provided the structure, CSS offered the means to style and design web pages. Learning about selectors, properties, and values was like learning a new language, and at times, it felt overwhelming. 
       </li>
       <li>
        with patience and perseverance, I started to see how CSS could transform plain HTML into visually appealing and dynamic websites.
       </li>
       <li>
        It was through these practical exercises that I gained confidence in my abilities and developed a deeper understanding of how HTML and CSS work together.
       </li>
       <li>
        Moreover, being part of a supportive learning community provided encouragement and motivation. Engaging with fellow learners, seeking advice on forums, and sharing insights and challenges helped me overcome obstacles and stay focused on my goals.

      <h2>Technical & Designing User interface analaysis</h2>
      <ul class="Section3">
      <li>
       I have used Visual Studio Code to implement the application.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tabs (Home,Project,Contact,Video Demonstartion,Site Report) as shown in the UI are rendered from Index.html page, which is a landing page.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have used IFrame to render html page inside another Html page.
       </li>
       <li>
        For each tab, there is a seperate html file,css file and js file,  logic of each tab is implemented inside specific html page.Used Javascript to toggle between tabs.
       </li>
       <li>
        Maintained folder structure for css , Html and Js so that application is more redable and maintainable.
       </li>
       <li>
        All the images are stored in a folder named Images under the project directory.This folder contains application level images.
       </li>
       <li>
         Header and left side sections is a  common layout for all tabs. So when we toggle from one tab to another , header and left side sections wont change.
        </li>
        <li>
            Left side section images are animated and will change every one second.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Design desicions on choosing css/fonts</h2>
      <ul class="Section1">
      <li>
        As per my analysis , light colours are more compatible and looks good.So i used light colous through out the applicaion.
      </li>
      <li>
        I implemented styles in seperate Css files.For all tabs i have maintained seperate css file under applcitaion directory,which are more readble and easy to maintain.
      </li>
       <li>
        Based on my analaysis and imagination towards implementing the application , i watched some youtube tutorials(KudVnekat) and gone through some documented tutorials(GeeksforGeeks.com , tutorailTeachers.com) to get more grip on Css. 
       </li>
       <li>
        Have used images and applied animations for the same using Css and Javascript.
       </li>
      </ul>
